```

Use @ to tag prompt in Cursr's AI text editor.

Each prompt template is designed to be used with AI assistants and follows a specific format:

1. **Architecture Planning**
   - Gathers project requirements
   - Facilitates tech stack decisions
   - Creates structured development plans
   - Validates against existing rules
   - Generates formatted planning documents

2. **Debugging**
   - Promotes thorough analysis
   - Challenges assumptions
   - Considers context and common issues
   - Provides structured problem-solving steps

3. **Best Practices**
   - Ensures code quality
   - Maintains detailed documentation
   - Promotes careful code modifications
   - Includes comprehensive comments for learning

4. **Research Queries**
   - Structures technical search queries
   - Includes relevant context
   - Specifies required technical details
   - Optimizes for human researchers

5. **Project Summary**
   - Generates project structure overviews
   - Documents key features
   - Tracks recent changes
   - Maintains detailed error resolution history

## üí° Usage

1. Open Cursor and choose the appropriate prompt template for your task
2. Tag the needed prompt in cursor Chat/Composer
3. Use with your preferred LLM

### Example Usage

Here's an example of using the debugging prompt template:

```markdown
@debug I'm encountering a TypeError in my React component:
TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined

Component code:

```jsx
const UserList = ({ users }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {users.map(user => <UserCard key={user.id} user={user} />)}
    </div>
  );
}


```

The AI will help analyze:
- Potential causes of undefined users prop
- Common React pitfalls
- Suggested fixes and best practices
