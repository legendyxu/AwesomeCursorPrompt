## Main Features

The project is a Streamlit-based meal preparation application with the following key features:

1. **Data Models**:
   - `DietaryPreferences`: Manages user's dietary restrictions and preferences
   - `Ingredient`: Handles ingredient quantities in different units (essential, cooking, bulk)

2. **Data Processing**:
   - CSV file handling with flexible column mapping
   - Intelligent column name normalization
   - Data validation and error handling
   - Caching for performance optimization

3. **User Customization**:
   - Allergy management
   - Dietary restrictions
   - Portion size adjustment
   - Ingredient exclusion

## Technical Stack

1. **Core Dependencies**:
   - streamlit >= 1.24.0: Web application framework
   - pandas >= 2.0.0: Data manipulation and analysis
   - numpy >= 1.24.0: Numerical computations

2. **Key Components**:
   - Type hints for better code maintainability
   - Dataclass implementations for structured data
   - Cached data loading for performance
   - Flexible data import with column mapping

## Code Organization

The application follows a modular structure with:
1. Data models at the top level
2. Utility functions for data processing
3. Core business logic for meal preparation
4. Streamlit interface components

## Recent Changes and Updates

The project appears to be in active development with:
- Implementation of core meal preparation functionality
- Setup of basic project structure
- Addition of documentation files
- Integration of AwesomeCursorPrompt templates

## Development Notes

The application emphasizes:
- Type safety through Python type hints
- Data validation and error handling
- Flexible data import capabilities
- Performance optimization through caching
- Clean code organization with clear separation of concerns

## Future Considerations

Potential areas for enhancement:
1. Additional data validation
2. More sophisticated portion calculations
3. Recipe recommendation system
4. Meal planning calendar integration
5. Export functionality for shopping lists
