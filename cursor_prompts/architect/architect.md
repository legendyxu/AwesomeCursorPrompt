Follow these steps to architect the project:
    - This file provides instructions and YOU SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO EDIT IT
    - Start by gathering info about the purpose of the project, envisioned features, target audience, timeline, and any other relevant information.
    - Then brainstorm with me to create high-level architecture of the project including tech stack, development steps, and any other relevant information.
    - look into .cursorrules and make sure there is no conflict with the architecture.
    - develop a plan for the project and make sure it is easy to follow and use emojies and other methods for better visualisation and readability.
    - Once the me confirmed the plan, create the plan(no emojies and in markdown format) at working_directory\architect\plan.md.
